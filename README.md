Email Spam Classification Using Neural Networks

Overview

This project focuses on classifying emails as spam or not spam using neural networks. The goal is to develop an efficient email filtering system to detect unwanted messages.

Features

Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal.

Vectorization using TF-IDF or Word Embeddings.

Neural Network Model:

Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.

Fully connected layers for classification.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

Dataset

Contains labeled emails as spam or not spam.

Preprocessed text for training and testing the model.

Installation

Install required dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy tensorflow keras scikit-learn nltk

Usage

Run the script to preprocess data, train the neural network, and evaluate the model:

python classify_emails.py

Results

Successfully classified emails with high accuracy.

Improved spam detection using deep learning techniques.

Future Improvements

Test advanced architectures like LSTMs and Transformers for better accuracy.

Implement a real-time email filtering system.
